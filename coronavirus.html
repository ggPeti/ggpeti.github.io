You are a factory worker and you come across a strange device. When you look closer, it is actually a drone - the kind that you bought your niece for her 10th birthday, just a bit larger. The drone opens at the slightest touch. Inside the drone, you find a paper note rolled up inside a bottle, like a weird mix between an Egyptian papyrus scroll and a message from Robinson Crusoe. You open the bottle, unroll the scroll, and it looks like a work note that usually gets distributed around the factory so that all workers know what their tasks are.
The note reads:

"
ATTENTION ALL WORKERS - PUT THIS INTO PRACTICE!

NSP1. Immediately reduce your work on all the usual products.
NSP2. Help all forklift drivers to deliver Q balls around the factory (see also NSP4, NSP6 and E for Q-balls).
