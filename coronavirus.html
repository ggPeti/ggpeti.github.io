You are a factory worker and you come across a strange device. When you look closer, it is actually a drone - the kind that you bought your niece for her 10th birthday, just a bit larger. The drone opens at the slightest touch. Inside the drone, you find a paper note rolled up inside a bottle, like a weird mix between an Egyptian papyrus scroll and a message from Robinson Crusoe. You open the bottle, unroll the scroll, and it looks like a work note that usually gets distributed around the factory so that all workers know what their tasks are.<br>
The note reads:<br>
<br>
"<br>
ATTENTION ALL WORKERS - PUT THIS INTO PRACTICE!<br>
